# Live-Photo
Live-Photo is a lightweight creative tool that turns live videos into share-ready moments by generating a doodle-style cover image from the video. It captures the vibe of the motion, adds a playful illustrated layer, and produces a striking cover that makes live content feel more expressive and easier to share across platforms.
